    <h2>Tokwa't Baboy</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ kilo pork belly</li>
            <li>4 pieces tofu</li>
            <li>2 medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>5 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons calamansi juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salted black beans</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>chinese celery (kinchay)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and prepare the tofu. Slice them into medium blocks.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil in a pan. Fry the tofu blocks until light brown and crispy on the outside. Flip them to cook the other side. Once browned, transfer them to a strainer or paper towel to drain excess oil. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In another pan, add the pork belly slices (no oil). Sear them nicely until oil starts to render. Then, remove some of the oil from the pan. Add the garlic and onion. Saute them for a few minutes. Then, add the tomatoes and salted black beans. Saute them all together for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the soy sauce and calamansi juice and then give it a little stir. Add some water, enough to cover the pork slices. Cover the pan and let it simmer for a few minutes until the pork is fully cooked and tender.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, slice the tofu blocks into smaller cubes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Check if the pork is tender by doing the fork test. Then, add the oyster sauce and black pepper. You may add a little sugar depending on your liking. Stir and give it a few minutes to cook until the sauce is reduced. Stir them from time to time to prevent the bottom from burning.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce is reduced and thick, add the fried tofu. Toss them gently for a few minutes until each tofu is well covered with the sauce. Lastly, add the chopped chinese celery as garnish.</li>
            <li>Transfer the tokwa’t baboy with tausi to a serving plate. Enjoy this with a big bowl of hot steaming rice. Yum!</li>
